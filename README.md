# mame-docker: tim011

## Prerequisites

* docker
* GNU make

## Run

```
make run
```

## Caveats

* Docker image download could last a long time the first time around.
* Once the program starts, focus the window that opens and press "enter"
  on each prompt.
* System boot takes quite a while. It may take a few minutes for first output
  to appear.
